# SSMOS
####...or the *Shitty Self Made Operating System!*

SSMOS sounds a little bit more professional, though.

A just-for-fun 32-bit x86 OS, mostly made for learning purposes.

Features include:
- Overly commented code!
- Extremely inefficient and outdated drivers!
- No multi-core, or even multi-process support!
- A poorly self-implemented standard C library!
- Text mode only! That's right, a whole 80x25 resolution!
- A single kernel heap, capable of using a whopping 14 megabytes! Besides, who needs more than 640k?
- Being strongly tied to the x86 architecture, making it unlikely to ever be ported!
