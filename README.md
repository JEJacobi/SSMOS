# SSMOS
A just-for-fun 32-bit x86 OS, mostly made for learning purposes.

Features include:
- Overly commented code!
- Extremely inefficient and outdated drivers!
- No multi-core, or even multi-process support!
- A poorly self-implemented standard C library!
- Text mode only! That's right, a whole 80x25 resolution!
- Strongly tied to the x86 architecture, making it unlikely to ever be ported!
